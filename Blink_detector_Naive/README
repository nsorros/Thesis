HICS blinks detector readme file

This is a blink detector we created for HICS conference

The main function to track_blinks in a video is track_blinks

A good function to start with is track_example which demonstates
the use of the function track_blnks with an example

There are some important observations to make

IN THIS FUNCTION
result] = CMU_tracker(video_path,start_frame,end_frame)

YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THIS LINE

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% imports the path to the CMU code
addpath('~/Dropbox/Research/Code/SUPERVISED-DESCENT/')
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

so that it points to the folder you have CMU tracker

To use this file you need to know two important dependencies:

DEPENDENCY ONE:

TRACKER

This work is based on top of the work that was done in Carnegie Mellon 
university under the name Supervised-Descent by Xuehan Xiong
Reference: http://www.ri.cmu.edu/pub_files/2013/5/main.pdf

IN CASE you want to use another tracker there are some things you have to change

[shape] = facial_feature_extraction(shape_path,video_path,tracker,start_frame,end_frame)
[upper_eye_points,downer_eye_points] = extract_eyes_indices(tracker)

DEPENDENCY TWO:

DATABASE

This code has been developed using Cultural Benchmarks database but it can easily
be generalised to another database. The main functions that needs altering is:

[video_name,video_number] = extract_video_information(video_path,database);
[question_number] = extract_question_number(database,video_number,i)

SPEAKING FOR DATABASES

track_database.m is the MAIN script to track a database
informations that can be used to analyse blinks in all videos
